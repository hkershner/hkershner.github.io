              of
              these

            <p>Given my survey results I decided to focus on the education field as our target market. With this in mind I felt that the brand should evoke the feeling of an encouraging and supportive classroom: someplace bright, happy, and sunny,
              yet
              relaxed and calm. With these emotions in mind I created a moodboard from which I pulled out the primary and secondary brand colors: a cool blue and a warm yellow.</p>

          <p>With the education field as my target market, I began sketching logo ideas that included images relating to clouds or to school. After some informal user testing, I landed on a simple drawing of a school desk within a circle. The
            desk
            is
            immediately recognizable to users and has a friendly, playful feel that coincides well with the overall brand approach. I chose the name cloudDesk in order to reference both our target market as well as clue users into what our
            product
            does.</p>

          <h3 class="conclusionTitle">what worked?</h3>
            <p>The branding I designed for cloudDesk was quite successful. During usability testing participants responded positively to the branding and often expressed feeling the brand emotions that I was trying to communicate via my design
              choices. Users during testing stated that the color choices made them feel “calm” and that the use of circle shapes (on the landing page) had a playful feel.

        </div>
        <div id="didNotWork">
          <h3 class="conclusionTitle">what didn’t work?</h3>
          <p>A major challenge I faced while working on this project was including unique functionality focused on the identified target market. I included two collaborative features to address this and to set cloudDesk apart from its
            competition:
            a collaborative to-do list and a chat feature. While I do think these features would be of use to teachers and students, I still think more could be done with this project to clearly establish the education field as its target market.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="keytakeaways">
          <h3 class="conclusionTitle">key takeaways</h3>
          <p>This project underscored for me the vital importance of user research throughout the design process. Whenever I felt stuck or unsure of how to proceed, a round of preference or usability tests would immediately shed some light and
            point me in the right direction. Moving forward I hope to conduct even more user research in future projects in order to create truly human-centered designs.

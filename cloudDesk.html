              <h1>Challenge</h1>
              <p>Lesson plans, projects, new academic standards--the modern educator has an ever increasing workload and it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and disorganized. Working together with colleagues provides enormous benefits for both
                students
                and
                teachers but finding the time to do so is often challenging. Today’s educators need an easy way to stay organized and to collaborate with their colleagues in order to support their students’ academic success.</p>

              <h1>Solution</h1>
              <p>cloudDesk offers a familiar yet unique cloud storage experience where users can upload, create, and organize content. Perfect for busy educators or students, users can quickly and easily find files based on file type or via a
                convenient
                search bar. Where cloudDesk really excels however is in collaboration--beyond sharing files and folders, cloudDesk users can also chat directly with their teammates from within the site as well as work together on a collaborative
                to-do
                list.
                Everything's better together!</p>

            <p>The results of my user survey confirmed that users do want to save, organize, and collaborate on content within the cloud. I learned that many users are concerned about the security of their data in the cloud and they have several
              ideas
              for
              enhancing collaboration, including the ability to chat and to work on a collaborative to do list.</p>

              <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
              <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest--the three most used cloud storage services among my survey respondents. After mapping out onboarding, organizing, and saving content user flows for each of
                these
                competitors, I determined that Google Drive and Dropbox had simpler flows than Pinterest. Given this I decided to leverage aspects of these flows in my own designs.</p>

                capabilities
                of the cloud in order to boost her own and her team’s productivity.</p>

              <p>Given my survey results I decided to focus on the education field as our target market. With this in mind I felt that the brand should evoke the feeling of an encouraging and supportive classroom: someplace bright, happy, and sunny,
                yet
                relaxed and calm. With these emotions in mind I created a moodboard from which I pulled out the primary and secondary brand colors: a cool blue and a warm yellow.</p>

              <p>With the education field as my target market, I began sketching logo ideas that included images relating to clouds or to school. After some informal user testing, I landed on a simple drawing of a school desk within a circle. The
                desk
                is
                immediately recognizable to users and has a friendly, playful feel that coincides well with the overall brand approach. I chose the name cloudDesk in order to reference both our target market as well as clue users into what our
                product
                does.</p>

              <p class="italic">What Worked?</p>
              <p>The branding I designed for cloudDesk was quite successful. During usability testing participants responded positively to the branding and often expressed feeling the brand emotions that I was trying to communicate via my design
                choices. Users during testing stated that the color choices made them feel “calm” and that the use of circle shapes (on the landing page) had a playful feel.

            <div id="didNotWork">
              <p class="italic">What Didn’t Work?</p>
              <p>A major challenge I faced while working on this project was including unique functionality focused on the identified target market. I included two collaborative features to address this and to set cloudDesk apart from its
                competition:
                a collaborative to-do list and a chat feature. While I do think these features would be of use to teachers and students, I still think more could be done with this project to clearly establish the education field as its target market.

            <div id="keytakeaways">
              <p class="italic">Key Takeaways</p>
              <p>This project underscored for me the vital importance of user research throughout the design process. Whenever I felt stuck or unsure of how to proceed, a round of preference or usability tests would immediately shed some light and
                point me in the right direction. Moving forward I hope to conduct even more user research in future projects in order to create truly human-centered designs.

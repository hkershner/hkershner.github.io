            <p>The majority of my survey respondents were young (75% were between the ages of 25 and 34), middle class, working professionals. They were dog owners who live primarily in or around urban centers across the United States. This data
              suggested that our target audience should be young, working professionals with an active lifestyle. The survey further confirmed that the primary problem our app should focus on solving is connecting dog-owners with local, dog-friendly
              locations.</p>

              <h2>competitive analysis</h2>
              <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of BarkHappy, PawParks, and Pet Connect. Through my research I determined that BarkHappy is our primary competitor. BarkHappy allows users to find local dog-friendly locations and seeks to foster a
                local community of dog owners. However, many users find this either off-putting (i.e. too similar to a dating app) or unnecessary. This offers an opportunity for a newcomer to enter this market: focusing on providing dog owners with
                detailed information about local dog-friendly places without forcing community-building.</p>

              <p>With the data from the user survey I constructed three user personas for this project. Tod Z. wants to quickly look up a location’s rules about dogs and to see those locations on a map. Brenda G. wants to read reviews of dog-friendly
                locations and to save her favorite ones so she can easily find them again. Cindy W. wants to advertise her business and increase foot traffic in her restaurant.</p>

              <p>In order to begin fleshing out the app’s brand I sketched out two word webs, one focused on dogs and one focused on exploration. From this brainstorm I identified the brand emotions and descriptive words to be dogs, family, love,
                fun, exercise, outdoors, sports, play, and joy. I then created a moodboard to evoke these words and feelings. From this moodboard I pulled out the app’s primary color palette: Purple Heart (HEX #6A4AD9) and Radical Red (HEX
                #FD4866).</p>

              <h2>logo design</h2>
              <p>I began sketching various logo ideas based on dogs: bones, collars, paw prints, and various images of dogs. Eventually I landed on an outline image of a dog’s face and I chose the name Yapper to evoke the brand feelings of fun and
                play. Originally I designed the logomark to sit behind the logotype however when I conducted preference testing, respondents overwhelmingly preferred to have the logomark to sit next to the logotype.</p>

            <h2>hi-fi mock ups and preference testing</h2>
            <p>With the previous usability test results and a style guide in hand I set about putting together high fidelity mockups of Yapper. In order to refine my designs I did a few rounds of preference testing.</p>

              <p>In my original designs I included a hamburger menu next to the search bar that opened a side menu. The side menu had three links: Your Account, Favorites, and Log Out. However, during usability testing using maze.design there was a
                33% misclick rate involving this screen. Based on these results, I decided to take out the hamburger menu and nest those three links in a tab bar.</p>

          <p>Yapper successfully addresses the user need of connecting dog owners with local, dog-friendly locations. Usability test results were overwhelmingly positive and users quickly navigated through the interface with little to no
            misclicks.</p>

        <div id="didNotWork">
          <h3 class="conclusionTitle">what didn’t work?</h3>
          <p>A challenging aspect of this project was branding, specifically the logo design. I went through several iterations with my first attempts coming out far too complicated. Through numerous revisions I eventually landed on the simple,
            monochromatic final logo.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="keytakeaways">
          <h3 class="conclusionTitle">key takeaways</h3>
          <p>Working through the full design process for this project was incredibly illuminating. Designing Yapper from scratch allowed me to wear several UX/UI hats and helped me to experience first hand the interconnectedness of each step in
            the process.</p>
